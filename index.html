  <body> Html can be a very tricky thing when using Github as your base for your operations. I have found that there are certain tags that will not work on the plaform. 
    Now if it is due to my ignorance or that I am still trying to fill out the environment would be a true thing to say. I mainly started this project so that I can practice my 
    HTNL code. one would ask why? Well, if you don't use it you will loose it. I don't want to forget how to use this markup language so here I am. I also noticed that unless the
    file name has an .md on it you will not be able to see the html work until you post it as a page online. This mean I can use all the tricks for html on thie page and they 
    will work!!
